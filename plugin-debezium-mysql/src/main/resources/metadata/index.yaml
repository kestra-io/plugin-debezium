description: "Tasks that ingest MySQL change data capture streams in Kestra using Debezium."
body: "Capture, Trigger, and RealtimeTrigger rely on the Debezium MySQL connector to write CDC records to Kestra storage and start flows. Configure hostname/port, credentials, a unique `serverId`, snapshotMode, and any include/exclude filters; use Trigger to batch events with maxRecords/duration controls or RealtimeTrigger for one execution per row."
